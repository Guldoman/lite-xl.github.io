Here are some frequently-asked questions.

#### Can I get smart autocompletion (intellisense/LSP)?
Check out the [LSP plugin](https://github.com/jgmdev/lite-xl-lsp).

#### Where is the integrated terminal?
Lite XL does not come with a terminal due to it's complexity.
For now, we have the [console plugin](https://github.com/franko/console) to run a command and dump its output. (not interactive)

#### Tabs and indent size?
In your user config (the cog icon in the file tree):
```lua
config.tab_type = "soft" -- soft for spaces, hard for real tabs (\t)
config.indent_size = 4   -- 4 spaces
```

#### How to bind commands to keys?
```lua
local keymap = require "core.keymap"
keymap.add { ["ctrl+escape"] = "core:quit" }
```

#### How to unbind commands for certain keys?
```lua
-- the second parameter lets you override commands for certain keys
-- in this case it maps it to nothing
keymap.add({ ["ctrl+escape"] = {} }, true)
```

#### How to get commands for those keybinds?
You can search for commands in the command palette.

For each command, replace the spaces in the right side with dashes.

For example: `Core: Find Command` â†’ `core:find-command`

#### Vim mode?
